The purpose of this homework was to build a note take that could write, save and delete notes using express backend.

For this homework I had to connect the front end which was already created to the backend. I used express to retrieve, post and delete notes from a JSON file.
This particular homework had troubled me, getting the routes to connect to the front end was difficult.

For this homework, it was also our first time using heroku. Unfortunately i thought i was commiting the whole time but did not realize you must commit to git hub and then to heroku, I kept committing to heroku and thought eveyrthing was being updated.
